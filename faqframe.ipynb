      "Q: What is the difference between the left and right column in Source Linker?\n",
      "A: The left column shows details from the historical record, while the right column shows details from the ancestor’s person page in Family Tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What do the Details and Compare buttons do in Source Linker?\n",
