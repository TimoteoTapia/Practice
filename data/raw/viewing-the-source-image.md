When you have questions about the details you see in Source Linker, try viewing either the source image or the person side panel for more information. 

## Viewing the source image


The source image is a digital image of the source. In many instances, it contains more information than what you see in Source Linker and might even reveal a mistake in the transcription.

 To view the source image, look in the top left corner of Source Linker, and click **View Image**.

## What is the difference between viewing the record and viewing the image?


When you click **View Record**, you see an organized summary of all of the details that were transcribed from the source.

 When you click **View Image**, you see a digital image of the actual source that was transcribed—in other words, you see the photograph of the birth certificate, census page, death certificate, or other historical document.

## Viewing the person side panel


The person side panel appears whenever you click a name in the right column of Source Linker. This panel gives you access to much of the information contained in the ancestor’s person page in Family Tree.  


* To view the side panel, find a name in the right column of Source Linker, and click it.
* Or click **View \_\_\_\_\_\_\_** (the person’s name), located at the top of Source Linker.
