The person or people in the right column of Source Linker come from the FamilySearch Family Tree. If you decide these people are not your ancestors, you can search the Family Tree for other possible matches.

1. At the top of the right column of Source Linker, under the words Family Tree, click **Find Your Family**.
2. FamilySearch generates a list of Family Tree profiles that potentially match your ancestors.
3. Review the list of possibilities, and select the one you think is the correct match.
