# Handling multiple spouses in Source Linker
















**Displaying the correct spouse**

When a person has more than one spouse in Family Tree and the correct spouse is not displayed in the right column in Source Linker, follow the instructions below to change spouses and display the correct one.  


1. In the right column, locate the incorrect spouse.
2. Below the incorrect spouse’s information, select Change Spouse, and then select the correct spouse.
3. If the information on the left is not aligned with the correct person on the right, drag and drop the information to the right location.

If you do not see the correct spouse:  


1. Return to the person page, and review the spouses. If you still do not see the correct spouse, use historical records to find information about the missing spouse.
2. Using this information, add the missing spouse to Family Tree.
3. Return to Source Linker, and attach the source.

**Displaying the correct children**

The children in the right column of Source Linker depend on the parents displayed. If you do not see the children you expect to see, they may belong to another spouse. To view these children:  


1. Select Change Spouse, and select the spouse who is the parent of the children you want to see. If the correct spouse doesn’t show as an option, you may need to add the spouse to Family Tree.
2. If the information on the left is not aligned with the correct person on the right, drag and drop the information to the right location.

**Attaching the source**

For all individuals in the left column who have a match on the right:  


1. Select Compare.
2. Verify the information.
3. If the information looks correct, explain why you are attaching the source in the Reason to attach source box.
4. To attach the record to the person in Family Tree, select Attach.

If you determine that a child is connected to an incorrect parent, follow the instructions in [How do I correct parent\-child relationships in Family Tree?](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/how-do-i-correct-parent-child-relationships-in-family-tree) When the relationships are correct, return to Source Linker, and attach the sources.

**Why am I seeing error icons?**

Error icons can appear for several reasons: for instance, perhaps the source you’re trying to attach is already attached to someone else.  


* An explanation for the error will usually appear to the left of the error icon. If not, hover over the icon to see the explanation.

When dealing with multiple spouses, you may also see error icons temporarily when a record contains children that belong to a different spouse. You do not have to do anything in this case. As soon as you switch back to the spouse who is the parent of the children, the error icons will disappear.
