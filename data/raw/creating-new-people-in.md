# Adding people to the Family Tree through Source Linker
















This option appears in Source Linker if a person from a record (left column) isn't identified in Family Tree (right column). This could happen for several reasons:  


 1. The person is in Family Tree but is connected to other relatives, not the ones on the record.
2. The person is connected to the family but is not lined up correctly in Source Linker. (See [Using drag and drop in Source Linker to organize families](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/using-drag-and-drop-to-organize-families).)
3. The person is not in Family Tree.

Before adding someone to Family Tree using Source Linker, check to make sure they are not already in Family Tree. If you determine they need to be added:

1. Drag the person's name to the correct line in the left column.
2. Click the blue **Add** button.
3. A panel will appear on the right side of the page with information about the new person filled in. Review it, and addany necessary changes or additions.
4. Click **Create New Person**. The person is added to Family Tree.
