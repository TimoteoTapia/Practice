# Tagging sources in Source Linker
















When you tag a source, you turn it into a reference for a detail listed on the person page in Family Tree. The option to create a tag appears in the left column of Source Linker after you click the purple Compare button. 

## What are the different categories of tags?


Depending on the information contained in the source, you can tag the source to any of the details mentioned on the person page, including:  


* Name
* Birth
* Death
* Sex
* Christening
* Burial
* Residence

To tag the source to the detail, click **the checkbox** that appears next to it. You can also remove the source from a particular detail by unchecking the checkbox.
