# Viewing the image or record from Source Linker
















When you have questions about the details you see in Source Linker, try viewing either the record or the source image for more information. If available, the link to either resource will appear directly above the left column of Source Linker.  


 ## Viewing the record


The record is a digital transcription of the information contained in the source. It is the source as it was read and interpreted by either a volunteer or a computer.  


* The benefit of viewing the record is that the information is clear and easy to read.
* With that said, if there is a mistake in the transcription, you will not be able to identify that mistake by viewing the record alone.

## Viewing the image


The image is a photograph of the actual source. It contains everything that was written, typed, or printed on the source. In most cases, it is a more complete resource than the record.  


## Where to look


To view the record or the image, go to the top of the left column of Source Linker, and click **View Record** or **View Image**.  


* A viewing panel will open on the right side of the screen where you can explore the resource without losing your place in Source Linker.
* If you do not see a link for viewing the image, it may be that FamilySearch does not currently own the rights to share the digital image.
