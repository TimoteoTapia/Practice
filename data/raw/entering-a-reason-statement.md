# Entering a reason statement in Source Linker
















You have the opportunity to enter a reason statement any time you delete, edit, or add to the information already contained in the FamilySearch Family Tree.  


* A clearly worded reason statement helps other users understand why you modified the Tree, and they, in turn, will be less likely to undo or change your work.
* Your reason statement does not need to be long or complicated.
* Short is fineâ€”as long as the statement is clear and specific.
