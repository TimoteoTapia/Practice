### Section 1



# Tagging sources in Source Linker
















When you tag a source, you turn it into a reference for a detail listed on the person page in Family Tree. The option to create a tag appears in the left column of Source Linker after you click the purple Compare button. 

## What are the different categories of tags?


Depending on the information contained in the source, you can tag the source to any of the details mentioned on the person page, including:  


* Name
* Birth
* Death
* Sex
* Christening
* Burial
* Residence

To tag the source to the detail, click **the checkbox** that appears next to it. You can also remove the source from a particular detail by unchecking the checkbox. 











### Section 2



# Understanding the Source Linker screen layout
















Source Linker consists of a left column and a right column.  


* The left column shows you details from the historical record.
* The right column shows you details from the ancestor’s person page in Family Tree. If the ancestor is not in Family Tree yet, you will see an option for adding the ancestor.

In most cases, you are using Source Linker to add the record to an existing ancestor’s person page. Added records serve as evidence that the ancestor’s details in Family Tree are accurate.











### Section 3



# Adding people to the Family Tree through Source Linker
















This option appears in Source Linker if a person from a record (left column) isn't identified in Family Tree (right column). This could happen for several reasons:  


 1. The person is in Family Tree but is connected to other relatives, not the ones on the record.
2. The person is connected to the family but is not lined up correctly in Source Linker. (See [Using drag and drop in Source Linker to organize families](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/using-drag-and-drop-to-organize-families).)
3. The person is not in Family Tree.

Before adding someone to Family Tree using Source Linker, check to make sure they are not already in Family Tree. If you determine they need to be added:

1. Drag the person's name to the correct line in the left column.
2. Click the blue **Add** button.
3. A panel will appear on the right side of the page with information about the new person filled in. Review it, and addany necessary changes or additions.
4. Click **Create New Person**. The person is added to Family Tree.

For information on how to add Others on Record to Family Tree, see [Unfinished Attachments \- How to add Others on Record to Family Tree.](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/unfinished-attachments-how-to-add-others-on-record-to-family-tree)











### Section 4



# Not your family? Start a new search in Source Linker
















The person or people in the right column of Source Linker come from the FamilySearch Family Tree. If you decide these people are not your ancestors, you can search the Family Tree for other possible matches.

1. At the top of the right column of Source Linker, under the words Family Tree, click **Find Your Family**.
2. FamilySearch generates a list of Family Tree profiles that potentially match your ancestors.
3. Review the list of possibilities, and select the one you think is the correct match.

   












### Section 5



# How do I handle unfinished attachments in Family Tree?
















In Family Tree, you can see the message, “This source has not been attached to all people found in the record,” on some sources. The source contains information about one or more people, and the source is not attached to them.  


## Steps (website)


1. On a person’s Sources tab, click **Unfinished Attachments**.
2. Use the source linker to do one of the following:   

	* Attach the record to the other people whose records are already in Family Tree.
	* Add the missing people to Family Tree.   
	
		+ **Important:** Before you add a person to Family Tree from the record, be sure to indicate whether the person is living. FamilySearch keeps information about living people private. If the person is marked as living, only you are able to see this record in Family Tree.
	* Nothing. Some records, like obituaries, mention people that are not closely related to the primary person on the record.
3. To dismiss the unfinished attachment notification, click **Dismiss**.   

	* **Tip:** If you dismiss the unfinished attachment notification, the notification is removed for all users. You cannot go back and review the dismissed notification. However, you can review the attachments for all sources attached to a person in Family Tree. Simply click the source's title, and then click **Review Attachments**.
4. If you do not want to see the unfinished attachments messages, click **Options** at the top of the Sources tab. Click the **switch** next to **Unfinished Attachments**. The option remains off until you turn it back on again.

## Steps (mobile app)


1. Navigate to a person page in the FamilySearch Family Tree app.
2. Below the dark bar with the name, tap **Sources**.
3. Find a source with the message "This source has not been attached to all people found in the record."
4. Tap **Review Attachments**.
5. Tap a name in the list that does not show a check mark.
6. If you want to attach the source, enter a reason to attach, and tap **Yes, Attach**. Otherwise, tap the back arrow to leave the review screen, and tap **Leave**.
7. To dismiss the notification, tap **Dismiss**

### Section 6



# Using Source Linker to attach a record to multiple ancestors
















 

Historical records often include the names of other family members. You can use Source Linker to attach the source to any family member already included in Family Tree. If the person is not yet in Family Tree, you can add the person, and then attach the source after that.

Here is how it works:  


1. Review the left column of Source Linker, and look for the names of other family members.
2. When you find the name of another family member, see if there is a corresponding name in the right column. (Hint: if the corresponding names are on different lines, you can drag and drop them with your mouse so that they line up together.)
3. Click the purple **Compare button**.
4. Review the information, and determine if the 2 sides of Source Linker are describing the same person.
5. If the answer is yes, leave a reason statement that explains how you came to your conclusion, and click **Attach**.

**Note:** If something in the source is new or missing from Family Tree, you will have to first click **Add** to add the detail to the right column and then click **Attach**.











### Section 7



# Viewing the source image and side panel in Source Linker
















When you have questions about the details you see in Source Linker, try viewing either the source image or the person side panel for more information. 

## Viewing the source image


The source image is a digital image of the source. In many instances, it contains more information than what you see in Source Linker and might even reveal a mistake in the transcription.

 To view the source image, look in the top left corner of Source Linker, and click **View Image**.

## What is the difference between viewing the record and viewing the image?


When you click **View Record**, you see an organized summary of all of the details that were transcribed from the source.

 When you click **View Image**, you see a digital image of the actual source that was transcribed—in other words, you see the photograph of the birth certificate, census page, death certificate, or other historical document.

## Viewing the person side panel


The person side panel appears whenever you click a name in the right column of Source Linker. This panel gives you access to much of the information contained in the ancestor’s person page in Family Tree.  


* To view the side panel, find a name in the right column of Source Linker, and click it.
* Or click **View \_\_\_\_\_\_\_** (the person’s name), located at the top of Source Linker.











### Section 8



# What to do when the names in Source Linker don't match
















If you determine that the names in the left column of Source Linker are not referring to the person or people in the right column, you can mark the source **Not a Match**:  


1. Next to the Attach button, select **Not a Match**.
2. Select the applicable **check boxes**.
3. If desired, add more detail in the Other Reason box.
4. Select **Not a Match**.
5. Repeat the steps above for other people in the right column as needed.











### Section 9



# A new look and feel for Source Linker
















We’ve improved our technology to provide a faster, more secure experience. We’ve also updated the design to make room for new features that help you link sources to your ancestors. 

For example, we added color to various links and buttons to help users understand their options better.  


* The green Add button is for adding a person in the historical record to the FamilySearch Family Tree. If the ancestor is already in Family Tree, the green Add button will be for adding a detail or fact to an ancestor’s person page.
* The purple Compare button is for deciding if the person in the record is the same as the person in Family Tree. If this is the case, you can attach the record to the person’s profile.
* The detach button is for removing the connection between the historical record and the person in Family Tree. You would do this if you discovered that the person in the historical record is different from the person mentioned in Family Tree.

We also created a separate viewing panel on the right side of the screen for viewing records and person profiles from Family Tree.

The panel is an important addition because it allows you to view this information without leaving the Source Linker.

The panel opens when you click on a person’s name or click the button to view the record.











### Section 10



# What are the benefits of adding sources to Family Tree?
















A source is historical material. Examples include a picture, journal, Bible, document, or other item that contains evidence about your family history. Sources are critical to the genealogical process for documentation and discovery. In Family Tree, you can attach sources to people, couple relationships, parent\-child relationships, and other relationships.

Sources provide many benefits:  


* They make it easier for users to work together in Family Tree. Sources can settle or prevent disputes.
* They add richness to the tree. Information about your ancestors on a record can increase your awareness that your ancestors were real people and that you really are connected to them.
* They demonstrate the accuracy of the information in the tree.
* They help you evaluate conflicting information. When you find conflicting information, such as 2 different birth dates for the same person, sources can help determine which one is most likely to contain the correct information.
* They acknowledge work done by others.

### Section 11



# Editing your family tree from Source Linker
















The details in the right column of Source Linker come from Family Tree. If you see a purple Compare button next to a person’s name, you can edit some of these details. Here is how it works:  


 1. Click the purple **Compare button** next to the person’s name whose Family Tree details you would like to edit.
2. With the details expanded, look for the purple label that says **Different**. This label appears when a detail from the source (left column) is different than a detail currently contained in Family Tree. 

Please note that even though it says Different, that does not necessarily mean a change needs to be made.
3. Click the **pencil icon** next to the purple label.
4. A pop\-up box with information from Family Tree will appear. Find the detail you want to edit, and make your update.
5. Click **Save**.

If the detail you want to edit is not accompanied by the pencil icon, you will need to go to the ancestor’s person page to make the update.  


1. In the right column of Source Linker, click the name of the person whose Family Tree information you would like to edit.
2. Look in the person panel that appears on the right side of the screen, and click **View Person**.
3. Scroll through the **Details tab** until you see the detail you want to edit, and click the **pencil icon**.










### Section 12



# Viewing the image or record from Source Linker
















When you have questions about the details you see in Source Linker, try viewing either the record or the source image for more information. If available, the link to either resource will appear directly above the left column of Source Linker.  


 ## Viewing the record


The record is a digital transcription of the information contained in the source. It is the source as it was read and interpreted by either a volunteer or a computer.  


* The benefit of viewing the record is that the information is clear and easy to read.
* With that said, if there is a mistake in the transcription, you will not be able to identify that mistake by viewing the record alone.

## Viewing the image


The image is a photograph of the actual source. It contains everything that was written, typed, or printed on the source. In most cases, it is a more complete resource than the record.  


## Where to look


To view the record or the image, go to the top of the left column of Source Linker, and click **View Record** or **View Image**.  


* A viewing panel will open on the right side of the screen where you can explore the resource without losing your place in Source Linker.
* If you do not see a link for viewing the image, it may be that FamilySearch does not currently own the rights to share the digital image.










### Section 13



# Understanding the focus person in Source Linker
















The focus person is the central figure in Source Linker. All other individuals are displayed in relation to that person.

## How do I know which name is the focus person?


When you open Source Linker, the focus person will appear under a blue bar near the top of the two columns of Source Linker. The name of the focus person also appears at the top of the page on the left as a link. 

The link opens a new tab with more detailed information about this person.  


## Can I change the focus person?


Yes. Here’s how:  


1. Find the current focus person on either column of Source Linker.
2. In the blue bar above the focus person’s name, click **Change Person**.
3. Review the list of options, and select a new focus person.

## Why would I change the focus person?


Changing the focus person gives you the ability to re\-order the relationships so you can see if the source can be attached to more people.  












### Section 14



# View records and Tree profiles without leaving Source Linker
















Previously, clicking the record or the person link in Source Linker took you to a new page. While the information you found there could be helpful, the overall experience was less than ideal because you had to leave Source Linker to get to it.   


 * To improve this experience, we created a new viewing panel that appears to the right of the Source Linker columns.
* The panel opens whenever you click the View Record button or the name of a person in the right column of Source Linker.










### Section 15



# Entering a reason statement in Source Linker
















You have the opportunity to enter a reason statement any time you delete, edit, or add to the information already contained in the FamilySearch Family Tree.  


* A clearly worded reason statement helps other users understand why you modified the Tree, and they, in turn, will be less likely to undo or change your work.
* Your reason statement does not need to be long or complicated.
* Short is fine—as long as the statement is clear and specific.











### Section 16



# What is my source box?
















Your source box lets you reuse sources instead of retyping them each time you need to use them. To view yoursource box, click your name in the upper right corner, and from the drop\-down menu, click **Source Box**.

Features of source box include:  


* Storage of more than 10,000 sources.
* The ability to organize your sources in up to 200 folders.
* Adding sources of your own into Family Tree.
* Gathering historical records and attaching them to records of ancestors.
* Print sources directly from the View page of individual sources.

For details on how to perform these tasks, view the articles linked below.

### Section 17



# Using drag and drop in Source Linker to organize families
















In most cases, the names that you see listed in the left column of Source Linker represent members of the same family. If the names on the left column are not aligned correctly with the names on the right, you can rearrange them by dragging and dropping them with your mouse. This includes the names of relatives that appear in the “Other” section at the bottom of the left column.

If a name can be moved, the drag\-and\-drop icon will appear when you hover the mouse over that name.

To move a name:  


1. Click and hold the mouse button down over a name.
2. Drag the name to the appropriate location in the left column.
3. Release the mouse button to drop the name.

## If there is no matching name


If there are no matching names but you are confident that a name in the left column is a family member, see [Adding people to the Family Tree through Source Linker](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/creating-new-people-in-family-tree)











### Section 18



# What are record hints in Family Tree?
















Record hints are historical records that Family Tree finds for you about your ancestors. Family Tree conducts this search automatically. In fact, since we are always adding new historical records to FamilySearch, our hinting system is always looking for new record hints about your ancestors.  


## How do record hints help me?


Record hints can help you learn more about your ancestors. You may learn your ancestor’s occupation or find a physical description. A record hint may identify missing children, parents, siblings, and other relatives. You can transfer information from the record to Family Tree without having to retype it.  


## What should I do with record hints?


To get the most from record hints, you do three basic tasks:  


* Make sure that the record hint really is about your ancestor.
* Transfer any information that you want from the record hint to Family Tree. (On the website, you cannot currently replace information that is already in Family Tree with better information from the record. Instead, you will need to go into Family Tree and make those updates manually. You can replace information already in FamilyTree when attaching using the mobile Family Tree app.)
* Attach the record hint to your ancestors in Family Tree. This saves the record as a source to your ancestors' records in Family Tree.

### Section 19



# Using Source Linker to attach sources
















Source Linker uses a purple Compare icon to notify you that the left column (the source) has information that the right column (Family Tree) is missing.

When Source Linker first opens, the information for [the focus person](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/understanding-the-focus-person-in-source-linker) will be expanded in both columns. If you decide that the columns describe the same person, you can move the information from the left column to the right column so that it appears in both columns. This is what we call attaching the source to Family Tree. Let’s take a closer look at how it works.  


1. With Source Linker open, click the purple **Compare icon**. If you do not see the Compare icon, the source is already attached, or it does not contain any new information.
2. After you click **Compare**, the two Source Linker columns expand so that you can see the details on the record (left column) and compare them with the details already contained in Family Tree (right column).
3. A new or previously unknown detail will be accompanied by a green plus button.
4. If they describe the same person, you can add the detail to Family Tree by clicking the green **plus button**.
5. Consider entering an explanation in the Reason field. Briefly explain why you think the record is a reliable match for the Tree person. This will help other users trust your contribution.

**What the purple Different tag means**

In some cases, the detail in the record is not necessarily new, but it is just different from what you see in the Family Tree side of Source Linker. For example, a name could be spelled differently, or the date for an important life event could be different.

When this happens, you will not see the green plus button. Instead, the detail will be accompanied by a purple tag with the word Different inside it and a small pencil icon for editing the information in Family Tree.  


* The Different tag does *not* always mean a change needs to be made. For example, if a birth year on the record is an estimate, but the birth year in Family Tree came from a birth certificate, you would want to keep the birth year already in Family Tree.
* If you decide that the information in the left column is more accurate or complete, click the pencil icon, and make your edit.
* Your correction makes the Tree more accurate and reliable for other users.











### Section 20



# Handling multiple spouses in Source Linker
















**Displaying the correct spouse**

When a person has more than one spouse in Family Tree and the correct spouse is not displayed in the right column in Source Linker, follow the instructions below to change spouses and display the correct one.  


1. In the right column, locate the incorrect spouse.
2. Below the incorrect spouse’s information, select Change Spouse, and then select the correct spouse.
3. If the information on the left is not aligned with the correct person on the right, drag and drop the information to the right location.

If you do not see the correct spouse:  


1. Return to the person page, and review the spouses. If you still do not see the correct spouse, use historical records to find information about the missing spouse.
2. Using this information, add the missing spouse to Family Tree.
3. Return to Source Linker, and attach the source.

**Displaying the correct children**

The children in the right column of Source Linker depend on the parents displayed. If you do not see the children you expect to see, they may belong to another spouse. To view these children:  


1. Select Change Spouse, and select the spouse who is the parent of the children you want to see. If the correct spouse doesn’t show as an option, you may need to add the spouse to Family Tree.
2. If the information on the left is not aligned with the correct person on the right, drag and drop the information to the right location.

**Attaching the source**

For all individuals in the left column who have a match on the right:  


1. Select Compare.
2. Verify the information.
3. If the information looks correct, explain why you are attaching the source in the Reason to attach source box.
4. To attach the record to the person in Family Tree, select Attach.

If you determine that a child is connected to an incorrect parent, follow the instructions in [How do I correct parent\-child relationships in Family Tree?](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/how-do-i-correct-parent-child-relationships-in-family-tree) When the relationships are correct, return to Source Linker, and attach the sources.

**Why am I seeing error icons?**

Error icons can appear for several reasons: for instance, perhaps the source you’re trying to attach is already attached to someone else.  


* An explanation for the error will usually appear to the left of the error icon. If not, hover over the icon to see the explanation.

When dealing with multiple spouses, you may also see error icons temporarily when a record contains children that belong to a different spouse. You do not have to do anything in this case. As soon as you switch back to the spouse who is the parent of the children, the error icons will disappear.











### Section 21



# Using Source Linker to detach sources
















Source Linker has blue detach buttons and yellow detach buttons. Each one removes the connection between a source and a person in Family Tree but for a different purpose. 

### Blue detach button


A blue detach button signifies that the source information in the left column is already attached to the person in the right column.   


* In this situation, clicking the blue detach button removes the connection between the information in the two columns.
* You would only want to click the blue detach button if you are certain that the source (left column) and Family Tree (right column) are referring to two separate people.

### Yellow detach button


A yellow Detach button means that the source (left column) is attached to a different person than the one you see in the right column of Source Linker.   


* In this situation, clicking the yellow Detach button removes the connection between the source and the *other* profile in Family Tree.
* You would only want to click the yellow Detach button if you are certain that the people you see in the two columns of Source Linker are the same and that the previous attachment was a mistake.

Once you detach the source from the other profile, you can attach it to the person in the right column of Source Linker. 











### Section 22



# Determining in Source Linker if a source matches your ancestor
















Identifying a match is not always easy. Here is some guidance from experts to help you determine if a record matches an ancestor or not:  


 * Ask yourself, “How well does the source match the vital dates, places, and relationships already contained in Family Tree?”
* Ask yourself, “Is there *enough* information to conclude that the record and Family Tree are describing the same person?” Some christening records, for example, list a mother’s or father’s name but no other vital information, such as age or date of birth. While a name is important, it is never a good idea to conclude that a source is about a certain person in Family Tree based on the name alone.
* Ask yourself, “Are there any major red flags?” For example, consider a situation in which most of the details on the record seem to match Family Tree—except for the birth year, which is off by 15 years. In that case, the record might actually be for a cousin.
* Ask yourself, “How trustworthy is the record?” In general, a historical record closest to the event is the most trustworthy. For example, a birth record is more trustworthy for birth information than a death record that might also include birth information.

Finally, keep in mind that errors can be more common in certain types of records than in others. For example, a census taker might have written down names without asking how to spell them correctly. Or a person’s age might have been an approximation.  
On a birth certificate, by contrast, you can expect such details to be more reliable.











### Section 23



What are record hints in Family Tree? 






Record hints are historical records that FamilySearch finds for you about your ancestors. These hints can often help you identify missing children, parents, siblings, and other relatives in your family tree. [Learn more](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/what-are-record-hints-in-family-tree) about record hints. 





What is the difference between the left and the right column in Source Linker?






The left column shows you details from the historical record. The right column shows you details from the ancestor’s person page in the FamilySearch Family Tree.





What do the Details and Compare buttons do in Source Linker?






The Details button expands both the record details (left column) and the person details (right column)  
  
The Compare button also expands the record details and the person details. In addition, if information in the record is not already in Family Tree, you will see green Add buttons that allow you to add the information.





What is my source box?






Your [source box](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/what-is-a-source-box) contains a list of sources that you have saved. In your source box, you can create, edit, and organize sources. You can also copy them and attach them to profiles in the Family Tree.   
  
Selecting **Add to** [**Source Box**](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/what-is-a-source-box) in Source Linker saves the source’s bibliographic information to your FamilySearch account. After that, you can revisit the source any time you want:  
1. Sign in to FamilySearch.
2. In the top right corner, click your name.
3. Click **Source Box**.






How do I give feedback to FamilySearch about Source Linker?






We want to know what you think about Source Linker. Here’s how to give feedback:  
  
1. At the bottom of the Source Linker page, click the Feedback button.
2. Select the emoji that best describes your reaction.
3. In the feedback box that opens, enter your thoughts and suggestions.

  
Thank you for sharing!





I’m stumped. How can I get help with Source Linker?






The Source Linker Learning Center is a great first option. You can also visit [FamilySearch Help and Learning](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/landing) or contact [FamilySearch Support](https://www.familysearch.org/en/fieldops/familysearch-support-contact-us).





Why is attaching a source important?






Sources help answer questions and make information about ancestors more accurate. They also make exploring the Tree a richer, more inspiring experience. These are just a few of the [benefits of attaching sources](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/what-are-the-benefits-of-adding-sources-to-family-tree) to the FamilySearch Family Tree. 





What do I do with an unfinished attachment?






An unfinished attachment is a source that has not been attached to all of the people mentioned in the source. If you encounter an [unfinished attachment](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/how-do-i-handle-unfinished-attachments-in-family-tree), try reviewing it and attaching it to the other relatives mentioned in it.
