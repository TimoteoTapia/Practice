# Editing your family tree from Source Linker
















The details in the right column of Source Linker come from Family Tree. If you see a purple Compare button next to a person’s name, you can edit some of these details. Here is how it works:  


 1. Click the purple **Compare button** next to the person’s name whose Family Tree details you would like to edit.
2. With the details expanded, look for the purple label that says **Different**. This label appears when a detail from the source (left column) is different than a detail currently contained in Family Tree. 

Please note that even though it says Different, that does not necessarily mean a change needs to be made.
3. Click the **pencil icon** next to the purple label.
4. A pop\-up box with information from Family Tree will appear. Find the detail you want to edit, and make your update.
5. Click **Save**.

If the detail you want to edit is not accompanied by the pencil icon, you will need to go to the ancestor’s person page to make the update.  


1. In the right column of Source Linker, click the name of the person whose Family Tree information you would like to edit.
2. Look in the person panel that appears on the right side of the screen, and click **View Person**.
3. Scroll through the **Details tab** until you see the detail you want to edit, and click the **pencil icon**.
