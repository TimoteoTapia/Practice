# Understanding the Source Linker screen layout
















Source Linker consists of a left column and a right column.  


* The left column shows you details from the historical record.
* The right column shows you details from the ancestor’s person page in Family Tree. If the ancestor is not in Family Tree yet, you will see an option for adding the ancestor.

In most cases, you are using Source Linker to add the record to an existing ancestor’s person page. Added records serve as evidence that the ancestor’s details in Family Tree are accurate.
