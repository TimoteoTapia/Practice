# Using Source Linker to detach sources
















Source Linker has blue detach buttons and yellow detach buttons. Each one removes the connection between a source and a person in Family Tree but for a different purpose. 

### Blue detach button


A blue detach button signifies that the source information in the left column is already attached to the person in the right column.   


* In this situation, clicking the blue detach button removes the connection between the information in the two columns.
* You would only want to click the blue detach button if you are certain that the source (left column) and Family Tree (right column) are referring to two separate people.

### Yellow detach button


A yellow Detach button means that the source (left column) is attached to a different person than the one you see in the right column of Source Linker.   


* In this situation, clicking the yellow Detach button removes the connection between the source and the *other* profile in Family Tree.
* You would only want to click the yellow Detach button if you are certain that the people you see in the two columns of Source Linker are the same and that the previous attachment was a mistake.

Once you detach the source from the other profile, you can attach it to the person in the right column of Source Linker.
