In Family Tree, you can see the message, “This source has not been attached to all people found in the record,” on some sources. The source contains information about one or more people, and the source is not attached to them.  


## Steps (website)


1. On a person’s Sources tab, click **Unfinished Attachments**.
2. Use the source linker to do one of the following:   

	* Attach the record to the other people whose records are already in Family Tree.
	* Add the missing people to Family Tree.   
	
		+ **Important:** Before you add a person to Family Tree from the record, be sure to indicate whether the person is living. FamilySearch keeps information about living people private. If the person is marked as living, only you are able to see this record in Family Tree.
	* Nothing. Some records, like obituaries, mention people that are not closely related to the primary person on the record.
3. To dismiss the unfinished attachment notification, click **Dismiss**.   

	* **Tip:** If you dismiss the unfinished attachment notification, the notification is removed for all users. You cannot go back and review the dismissed notification. However, you can review the attachments for all sources attached to a person in Family Tree. Simply click the source's title, and then click **Review Attachments**.
4. If you do not want to see the unfinished attachments messages, click **Options** at the top of the Sources tab. Click the **switch** next to **Unfinished Attachments**. The option remains off until you turn it back on again.

## Steps (mobile app)


1. Navigate to a person page in the FamilySearch Family Tree app.
2. Below the dark bar with the name, tap **Sources**.
3. Find a source with the message "This source has not been attached to all people found in the record."
4. Tap **Review Attachments**.
5. Tap a name in the list that does not show a check mark.
6. If you want to attach the source, enter a reason to attach, and tap **Yes, Attach**. Otherwise, tap the back arrow to leave the review screen, and tap **Leave**.
7. To dismiss the notification, tap **Dismiss**
