These hints can often help you identify missing children, parents, siblings, and other relatives in your family tree.

What is the difference between the left and the right column in Source Linker?






The left column shows you details from the historical record. The right column shows you details from the ancestor’s person page in the FamilySearch Family Tree.





What do the Details and Compare buttons do in Source Linker?






The Details button expands both the record details (left column) and the person details (right column)  
  
The Compare button also expands the record details and the person details. In addition, if information in the record is not already in Family Tree, you will see green Add buttons that allow you to add the information.





What is my source box?






Your [source box](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/what-is-a-source-box) contains a list of sources that you have saved. In your source box, you can create, edit, and organize sources. You can also copy them and attach them to profiles in the Family Tree.

Sources help answer questions and make information about ancestors more accurate. They also make exploring the Tree a richer, more inspiring experience.
